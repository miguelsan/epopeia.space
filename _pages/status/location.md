# The Location of Epopeia

The area we are [right now](/status) committed to, is found at the northern border between Portugal and Galicia (Spain).
The surrounding environment is naturally pretty intact, with a low human footprint, embedded in a less densely populated, politically very stable, technically developed and well supplied region. It is rural and aged, many services need to be rebuilt again.
And the particular valley has a specially sweet [history](http://www.calvosderandin.com/webjoomla/index.php/gal/couto-mixto-4/historia2){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"} to it, that makes it an unknown jewel and could turn it into a real magnet.
