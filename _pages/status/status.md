# The Status of Epopeia

### Status, systemically

We have identified and explored a physical area which we feel that really has the strongest potential for the project's success. There is both a local history of self-determination and current depopulation. Native inhabitants are regaining confidence on their special traditions and winds of change slowly arise. This allows for re-creating structures from the ground up in yet unexplored ways.

We bring in our knowledge and skills to propose this creative project that finds here ideal conditions to take place.

### Status, socially


We arrived in its outer region last year, and are moving into [the space](/status/location) this autumn. We are being very well received in both steps. We have now a very good understanding of the particularities of life here.

The social atmosphere in the space is somewhat surprisingly well connected, with a strong sense of identity and desire for honoring its roots of local empowerment.

### Status, personally

A year ago we as [project partners](/status/team) met and moved together by means of fulfilling this project. We have since created the strongest interpersonal ties as primary bonding partners and resonate with each other wonderfully. We have advanced in personal growth, from _let's do it_ to _we're doing it_.

We have distilled the content of this site as a first interface to the world, a summary for you reader to understand what we are creating. There are some other documents and ideas, that still need to be either organized or written down.

In parallel we are working on funding solutions that allow us to bring the project forward effectively. 

A baby should arrive in November, which makes our project's intergenerational perspective quite the most present on a daily basis.

### Next steps (as of July 2025)

**From now on**: We are looking for more core members and project partners to join and start this off. 

**August**: We'll present Epopeia at the [GEN Europe Gathering](https://ecovillagegathering.org/economy/){:target="_blank"} in Hungary. 

**October**: Moving into [the location](/status/location).  

**From then on**: Preparing the housing, the financial and legal infrastructure for people to come (founding an association, buying or renting homes, finding stakeholders, creating a community fund,â€¦ ).

**Further evolvement**: once we create a field for the community to come, we'll **facilitate projects aligned with our values**, which includes developing several business models. Want to do your project with us? [Please reach out!](/participate)
