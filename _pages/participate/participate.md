## Call for Participation

We are on a mission to offer the world a fundamental change. We offer plenty of hope, with the full potential to make your personal life, that of your beloved ones, that of the ideas that you believe in and work for day in and day out, truly and appreciably better. For that we need your felt solidarity and your active contribution on this task.

**Participate with your project** - You have a project that could benefit from a web of connected projects, and you like the idea of creating a new society? We are looking for pioneers who are ready to do this with us, realizing their own vision inside of the bigger structure of Epopeia.

Share this website with someone who could be interested. Contribute your ideas. Tell us what resonated and what didn't.
