### Epopeia builds on a global movement
of social-entrepreneurship, trauma-awareness and eco-villages, taking it one step further by [creating](/about/mission) a functional [holistic](/about/values) society:

- a local *community of communities*,
- a space to reach new layers of complexity and evolve forward as humanity,
- so that we can embrace our place in the universe.
