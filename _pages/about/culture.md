# The Culture of Epopeia

We are [inspired by](/about/motivation) and follow best (often leading-edge) practices in different life aspects (social, personal, environmental). For instance, at the [appropriate scale](/about/mission) we already [apply](/about/values): source work, agile management, dragon dreaming, sociocracy, possibility management, regenerative culture, gift economy, trauma-aware process work, self-determined education, art of hosting, intentional community building.
We are eager to discover, learn and apply the most agreeable methods in every possible field. In the [future](/about/vision), we are looking forward to use permaculture, theory U, commons & steward ownership, and many others.

For further current details: we are frugal hedonists (a term inspired by permaculture founder David Holmgren), buy bio quality products, recycle, not harm unnecessarily, try our best to be aware of our resources and privileges and use what is at our disposal with responsibility.

> Hint: We will expand these topics for more clarity at a later point.
