## The Mission of Epopeia

Our purpose is to create a blueprint for a new system that inspires and guides humanity towards a truly connected, sustainable, and fulfilling way of life â€” qualities already present in small, thriving intentional communities. We are so passionate about advancing to the next systemic level that we are founding Epopeia, an initiative to turn this blueprint into reality. In doing so, we nurture [the Vision](/about/vision), a Conscious Global Community.

Epopeia incorporates a set of communities with a shared identity, located in the same [physical bioregion](/status/location), coordinated and organized as a larger entity. This broader community demands new [structures and practices](/about/culture) to make it all-encompassing and sufficient, appealing and inspirational. This conscious, joyful, sustainable experience is embedded in a [new culture](/about/culture) that learns from the past while practicing stewardship of the Earth for future generations.

_Our mission is to give and hold space for this new sort of society, to birth it, and to help it mature._ Once proven, it will bring forth emergent [qualities](/about/values) that open new opportunities for humankind and can be extended to a wider scale. Epopeia aims to serve as a reference for others to adapt and improve upon, standing as a symbol of hope and a guiding beacon for humanity.
