# The Vision of Epopeia

## One Conscious Global Community

At this [historic crossroads](motivation), we embrace a path towards an advanced way of existence. In this new paradigm, we evolve united as a conscious organism, a global community of communities. We are guided by a shared purpose and a commitment to individual, collective, and universal well-being.

In this conscious organism of locally rooted communities, each maintains its agency, bringing forward its [unique culture](culture) and caring for its relationship with the specific environment. [We foster](values) unity within diversity, respecting each other's distinct ways, and thrive together by sharing knowledge, decisions, and resources.

This ecosystem is formed by conscious beings who heal the traumas that once hindered them. Bound by mutual awareness and genuine heartfelt connections, everyone honors a deep sense of belonging and is empowered to contribute to a cohesive, peaceful, and nourishing ecosphere for all life forms on Earth.

On the brink of this new era, it calls on each of us to [join](/participate/profile) and [participate](/participate) in a multi-generational process of creating this holy envisioned reality for ourselves and for everyone. [We are committed to](mission) it and are bringing it into the now. Thus, it has already started operating and transforming our personal and collective present. We believe and feel that humanity is ready to take its place in the universe.
