# Joining Profile

You have started loving yourself deeply, getting rid of some inner disturbances and are committed to your inner growth. You know that you can and want to live heartily close to others, tolerantly share experiences and patiently be touched. You intuit that some sort of transcendent reality permeates our physical laws without contradicting them.

You are convinced that humanity has the need and skills to deeply transform its dominant beliefs, methods, structures, towards a more sensible, sustainable and fulfilling lifestyle, whatever the challenges.

You feel that your life's purpose aligns with our Vision, that you can and want to contribute to the enjoyment and success of such a bold project as Epopeia, that your personal plans can develop in this special environment.
You can communicate in either Galician, Spanish, Portuguese, English, German, or are ready to learn any of them and teach yours to us.
