# About Epopeia

We are living through a time of uncertainty, an old system slowly dying and a new system not yet established. There's [immense potential](/about/motivation) for human development in this shift (though it can feel breathtaking and chaotic). Let us use this time of Turning and design a culture [for a better tomorrow](/about/vision) - with a project that builds on the global eco-village movement and takes it one step further, creating a functional, thriving society.

What is Epopeia? A meta-community, bringing [this movement](/about/culture) to the next level. How? By creating new structures (a community of communities, a family of communities) that can hold thousands of people while being locally grounded, and responsibly taking care for each other and our home planet. [We create](/about/mission) a new, complex society that can sustain itself. It reaches the systemic level and is able to take decisions to the next scale.

How do we start? We found the perfect [space](/status/location) in Galicia. We outlined the vision. It's far from complete, it will evolve with all the people that come. Now we need you, we invite you, to [contribute](/participate) and come here. There will be an open core team holding and facilitating [the vision of Epopeia](/about/vision). But Epopeia [needs people](/participate), groups of individuals, friends, families, tribes to become a society. We will start to build the web of community by inviting people and their projects, that, aligned with [our values](/about/values), fit into this developing society. We will start small-scale and move towards greater levels of complexity, thereby transforming the wider region while respecting its roots.

Project application is open! We are looking for [projects](/participate/profile) to start the journey. Projects could be a local bakery, a permaculture garden with workshops, a research project on spiritual development, a kindergarden, a 3D printing business, a summer festival, â€¦ all a village, a city, a society could need can be offered.

[Your life mission](/participate/profile) is to bring something special to the world? Aligned with the values of Epopeia, you aim to create something beautiful, whether big or small, and are looking for a space? [Get in touch](/participate/contact)!
